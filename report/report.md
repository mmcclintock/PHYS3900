# Methodology


## Content format

In order to address the project goals we started by looking at the content
format. What is an effective way to author content for a physics app and for
physics in general? Below are some characteristics of the content format which
we thought were important.

First the format should be simple. The generation of quality physics content is
what the author should be focusing on. The format shouldn't get in the
way. It should be simple enough that anyone can write content for the apps.

The format should be a well established standard with tested tools for
conversion to other formats.

It should be easy to insert text, math equations, images, videos links and
references.

The format we decided on was Markdown. The easiest way to describe the format
to show an example of content from the final app.

```markdown
# Buoyancy

Take the block of water inside the bucket on the left hand side. This
block of water is being upheld by the pressure in the liquid
underneath the block of water, while being pressed down by the force
of gravity.  Since this block of water is stationary, that means that
the force of gravity equals the force of buoyancy. So at this point:

$F_{gravity}=F_{buoyant}=m_f g$
```


The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible
